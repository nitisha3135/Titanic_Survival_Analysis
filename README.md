## Project Goal

In this project, I explore one of the most iconic datasets ever — **The Titanic** — and answer the real questions:

- Who survived and who didn’t?
- Did money, class, or gender decide your fate?
- Were women and children *really* saved first?
- What role did being alone or in a group play?

All done using:
- Clean pandas code
- Colorful & aesthetic Seaborn + Matplotlib visuals
- Some serious investigative drama

---

## Tools Used

- Python 
- Pandas  
- Seaborn   
- Matplotlib   
- Jupyter Notebook 

---

## Process

- Data cleaning: Filled missing values, fixed data types  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 10+ visualizations  
- Observations + Explanations in my ✨ personal ✨ language  
- Final conclusion: Who had the Titanic Survival Starter Pack™?

---

## Visuals You’ll See

- Gender vs Survival  
- Class vs Survival  
- Boxplots for age  
- Heatmaps, Pairplots, Countplots galore  
- The *real* drama of Deck data (or lack of it 💀)

---

## Key Findings

- Being a **woman or child = higher survival chance**
- **First class = luxury AND safety**
- Men and third-class passengers had the worst outcomes  
- Traveling alone wasn’t always bad... but large families? Chaos.
- Some variables like deck were so messy, even the ocean couldn’t wash it clean

## Author’s Note

This project is more than just code — it's storytelling with data.  
It’s insightful, emotional, and ✨ pink-coded ✨.

Yes, I can write professional reports — but here, I chose clarity, color, and vibes.
